# Multiple Linear Regression on Amazon Sales Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** using Python.  
The model is applied to the **Amazon Sales dataset from Kaggle**, which contains real-world sales data.  

The project is designed as a **template**:  
- You can easily replace the dataset (`.csv` file) with any other dataset.  
- The code automatically adapts to the new file, provided the dataset has numerical and categorical features suitable for regression.

## ⚙️ Features
- Clean and modular code for regression modeling.
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling).
- Model training and evaluation using metrics like **R² Score** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.
- Template-style structure: just change the CSV filename to apply the model to a new dataset.
